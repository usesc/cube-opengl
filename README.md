Cube in Modern OpenGL - Wireframe (because wireframe is cool) Whats even cooler is that its in C

I haven't deliberated over the code that much, meaning im not sure if it leaks memory, if I had to guess i'd say probably not though

Also, why is it so hard to find OpenGL projects in C? It's genuinely disheartening.
